Template for the Read the Docs tutorial

=======================================

Automatic documentation generation using [Sphinx-docs](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). I happen to be using a Readthedocs theme but there are many you can use. See the Sphinx documentation.

My repo has a GitHub Action set up to build the documentation on any push to the main branch. My repo is modeled off: `https://github.com/duong-dsg/mewo_project`

```cmd
pip install sphinx-autoapi
```
